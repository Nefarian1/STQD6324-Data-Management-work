# illustrate

Assignment1.ipynb, Assignment2.ipynb, Assignment3.ipynb, Assignment4.ipynb are  coded using Colab, so you can take a look at them directly.

The folders of assignment1 ~ assignment4 contain the corresponding files and requirements. Some processes of using puTTY, Hadoop, Ambari, SQL, PIG, HIVE, etc. are described in the .txt files in these folders.

There is also a folder with .py format, and a text file with the colab link of the four assignments. If the file on Google Cloud is deleted, the connection will probably become invalid.

ml-100k.zip is an example of my practice, which I got directly from the official website. For the original link, please refer to the assignment description.
